                <h2>Our Mission: Empowering Students with Data</h2>
                
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The college search process is overwhelming and confusing. Too often, it's driven by glossy marketing materials, 
                    brand prestige, and misleading "sticker prices" that don't reflect what students actually pay. This creates 
                    barriers for students—especially first-generation and low-income students—who don't have insider knowledge 
                    about how college pricing really works or which schools will best support their success.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    This tool cuts through the noise by focusing on the data that actually matters for student success. Instead 
                    of flashy rankings or reputation, we prioritize transparent, outcome-focused metrics that help you make an 
                    informed decision about where to invest your time, energy, and money.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>🎯 Built specifically for first-generation and Pell Grant-eligible students</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We designed this tool with you in mind—students who are navigating the college search without a roadmap, 
                        who need clear, honest information to make the best choice for their future.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Why This Matters for First-Gen & Pell Grant Students</h3>

                <p><strong>1. Net Price vs. Sticker Price: Knowing What You'll Actually Pay</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Many colleges advertise a high "sticker price," but after grants and scholarships, most students pay far less. 
                    This is called the <strong>net price</strong>—the real cost you'll face after financial aid. For first-generation 
                    and Pell-eligible students, understanding net price is critical because it's the number that impacts your daily 
                    life: your work hours, your stress level, and your ability to focus on your studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our tool uses <strong>actual net price data</strong>, not sticker prices, so you can see what families like yours 
                    truly pay. We also show you the <strong>affordability gap</strong>—how many hours you'd need to work each week 
                    at minimum wage to cover the remaining costs—because we know that financial reality matters.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Outcomes Over Prestige: Schools That Support You to Graduation</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Brand-name schools don't always deliver better outcomes, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds. 
                    What matters more is whether a school has a proven track record of supporting students like you all the way to 
                    graduation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we emphasize <strong>graduation rates</strong> and <strong>retention rates</strong>—especially for 
                    Pell Grant recipients. These metrics tell you: "Do students who start here actually finish? Are they supported 
                    through challenges?" A school with high retention and graduation rates for Pell students is a school that invests 
                    in your success, not just your enrollment.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Finding Your Community: Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    For many first-generation students, having a supportive community can make all the difference. That's why we include 
                    filters for <strong>Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)</strong> like Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), 
                    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These schools are specifically designated—and often funded—to serve and foster communities that have been historically 
                    underrepresented in higher education. They offer cultural support, mentorship, and resources tailored to your background. 
                    If finding a place where you can see yourself reflected in the student body, faculty, and mission matters to you, 
                    these filters help you identify those schools instantly.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>💡 Real-World Impact</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Research shows that first-generation students at MSIs graduate at higher rates and report stronger sense of 
                        belonging. Finding the right institutional fit isn't just about comfort—it's about your likelihood of success.

                <h3>Leveling the Playing Field</h3>
                <p>
                    Higher education should be a ladder of opportunity, not a locked gate. But for too long, the information advantage 
                    has belonged to families who already know how the system works—who understand net price, who know to look at retention 
                    rates, who have connections to help navigate the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to <strong>level the playing field</strong>. By putting transparent, outcome-focused data at your fingertips, 
                    we're empowering you to make the same informed, strategic decisions that privileged families have always been able to make.
                </p>

                    You deserve to know not just where you can get in, but where you can <strong>thrive</strong>, <strong>afford to stay</strong>, 
                    and <strong>successfully graduate</strong>. This tool is built to help you find exactly that.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Every metric in this tool was chosen with one question in mind: "Will this help a first-generation, 
                        Pell-eligible student find a college where they can succeed?" Your education is an investment in your future. 
                        You deserve data-driven support to make that investment wisely.
