                    College search shouldn't require insider knowledge. This tool helps you find schools where you can succeed 
                    and afford to stay, using transparent data instead of marketing materials.

                <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
                <p>
                    The college admissions process often feels designed for families who already know how it works. If you're 
                    the first in your family to go to college, or you're relying on Pell Grants and financial aid, you're 
                    navigating a system that wasn't built with you in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most college websites emphasize rankings, campus aesthetics, and sticker prices that few students actually pay. 
                    What's harder to find is the information that matters most: What will this actually cost me? Do students like 
                    me graduate from here? Will I find support if I struggle?
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This recommender focuses on outcomes, not prestige. We prioritize graduation rates, retention rates, 
                        and actual net prices—the metrics that tell you whether a school will support your success.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>

                <p><strong>Net Price</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Most colleges advertise a "sticker price" that includes tuition, fees, room, and board. But almost no one 
                    pays that full amount. After grants and scholarships, the <strong>net price</strong> is what you actually 
                    owe. This is the number that affects your daily life—whether you can work fewer hours, buy your textbooks, 
                    or focus on studying instead of worrying about bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also calculate an <strong>affordability gap</strong>, which shows how much you'd need to earn working 
                    part-time at minimum wage to cover costs beyond financial aid. It's a reality check: Can I afford this 
                    while also succeeding academically?
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>Graduation and Retention Rates</strong></p>
                <p>
                    A school might accept you, but will it support you through graduation? Graduation rates tell you what 
                    percentage of students who start at a school actually finish. Retention rates show how many first-year 
                    students return for their second year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pay special attention to <strong>Pell Grant recipient outcomes</strong>. If a school has strong 
                    graduation rates overall but low rates for Pell students, that's a warning sign. You want a school 
                    that supports students like you, not just its wealthiest enrollees.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>Minority-Serving Institutions</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Some schools are federally designated as Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) because they enroll 
                    significant numbers of students from underrepresented groups. These include Hispanic-Serving Institutions 
                    (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MSIs often provide mentorship networks, culturally responsive support services, and communities where 
                    students from similar backgrounds thrive together. Research shows that first-generation students at MSIs 
                    graduate at higher rates and report stronger belonging. If community matters to you, these filters can 
                    help you find schools built around it.
                </p>

                <h3>What Makes This Different</h3>
                <p>
                    Most college search tools are built by admissions offices or companies with financial incentives. 
                    They want you to apply broadly, click on ads, or consider schools that pay for placement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tool has no ads, no sponsored results, and no hidden agenda. It's built to help you make the best 
                    decision for your situation. We're not trying to maximize applications or drive traffic—we're trying to 
                    help students find schools where they'll succeed.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>A Note on Match Scores</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Your "match score" is personalized to your preferences. It combines your budget limits, desired 
                        graduation rates, state preferences, and MSI filters. A 100% match doesn't mean it's the #1 school 
                        in the country—it means it's the best fit for what you told us you're looking for.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Who This Is For</h3>
                <p>
                    This tool is designed with first-generation and Pell-eligible students in mind, but anyone can use it. 
                    If you value transparency, affordability, and outcomes over prestige, you're in the right place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe higher education should be a path to opportunity, not an obstacle course designed to favor 
                    those who already have advantages. Good data helps level that playing field.
                </p>
